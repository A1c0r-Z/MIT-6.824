#Lecture 1

Motivation:
1. high computation/parallelism
2. fault tolerence *eg: with two doing same job,if one goes wrong,we can use the other one*
3. physical reason: some problems are distributed naturally and physically *eg: two banks,one in London,one in NY*
4. security *eg: if you have some untrusted code,you may want it run in another mechine so that the error won't impact your machin*
